//! Calibration: build an ef → recall monotone table from sample queries.
//!
//! ## How it works
//!
//! 1. Run beam search at a set of candidate `ef` values on a small random
//!    sample of queries drawn from the data distribution.
//! 2. For each `ef`, compute mean recall@k against brute-force ground truth.
//! 3. Store the resulting `(ef, mean_recall)` pairs as a sorted table.
//! 4. At query time, binary-search the table to find the smallest `ef` ≥
//!    the caller's recall target.
//!
//! ## Monotonicity
//!
//! Recall is weakly monotone in `ef` for any fixed graph: larger beam width
//! can only find more neighbours. The table enforces this by sweeping in
//! ascending `ef` order and keeping a running maximum.
//!
//! ## Sample size
//!
//! Using ~5–10% of the dataset as calibration queries gives accurate estimates
//! without significant overhead. The calibration is one-time (amortised over
//! all subsequent queries).
